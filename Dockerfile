# Install the Seagate/kinetic-py code from Github, we also need
# git and python and some python add-ins so we install them too.
# Since this container may well run in interactive mode we also
# install things like emacs and ipython. As per Dockerfile best
# practices we split this up to get snapshots along the way.
